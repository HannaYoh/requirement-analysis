# requirement-analysis

This repository serves as a guide to understanding and performing requirement analysis in software development. It contains detailed information on the key steps of the process, including elicitation, analysis, documentation, validation, and management. By providing a structured overview, this resource aims to equip developers, project managers, and business analysts with the knowledge and tools necessary to gather, define, and refine project requirements effectively. The purpose is to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned from the very beginning, setting a solid foundation for a successful project and a final product that truly meets user needs.  
<h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>  
The process of requirement analysis can be broken down into several key steps: <br>
Elicitation: This is the initial stage where requirements are gathered from all relevant stakeholders, including customers, end-users, project managers, and domain experts. Techniques like interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and observation are used to collect a broad range of needs and expectations. <br>
Analysis and Negotiation: Once collected, the requirements are analyzed for consistency, completeness, and feasibility. This step often involves negotiation to resolve conflicts between stakeholders' needs, prioritize requirements, and identify any missing information. The goal is to produce a clear, unambiguous set of requirements. <br>
Documentation: All finalized requirements are formally documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This document serves as the official record of what the software will do. It typically includes functional requirements and non-functional requirements. <br>
Validation: The documented requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and are technically feasible. This step helps catch errors and misunderstandings early, preventing costly rework later in the project. <br>
<h2>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h2>  
Risk Mitigation <br>
Requirement analysis acts as a proactive measure against project failure. By defining all needs upfront, it prevents scope creepâ€”where project boundaries expand, leading to budget overruns and delays. <br>
Improved Communication <br>
The process creates a single source of truth for all stakeholders. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document serves as a common language, ensuring everyone from developers to clients has the same understanding of project goals, thus reducing misunderstandings. <br>
Ensuring User Satisfaction <br>
By involving end-users and other stakeholders early, requirement analysis guarantees the final product addresses their actual needs. This user-centric approach ensures the software is not just functional but also useful and intuitive, leading to a more successful outcome. <br>
<h2>Key Activities in Requirement Analysis</h2>  
- Requirement Gathering: This is the initial, broad activity of identifying all potential sources and stakeholders for a project's requirements. It focuses on understanding the general purpose and scope to ensure no key groups are missed. <br>
- Requirement Elicitation: A more specific process of drawing out detailed requirements from stakeholders. It uses structured techniques like interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation to get a clear and complete picture of what is needed. <br>
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling: During this stage, collected requirements are examined for completeness, consistency, and feasibility. Any conflicts or ambiguities are resolved. Modeling uses visual aids like flowcharts and use case diagrams to illustrate how the system will work. <br>
- Requirement Documentation: The formal process of writing down all finalized requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This document serves as the official agreement, detailing both functional and non-functional requirements. <br>
- Requirement Validation: The final step to ensure the documented requirements are correct and meet the customer's needs before development begins. It involves reviews, inspections, and prototypes to confirm the team is building the right product. <br>
<h2>Types of Requirements</h2>  
<b>Functional Requirement</b> <br>
- The system must allow a user to search for available appointments by date and time. <br>
- The system must allow a user to cancel a booking. <br>
- The system must send an email confirmation to the user after a booking is made. <br>
- The system must be able to generate a report of all bookings for a specific day.  <br>
<b>Nonfunctional Requirement</b> <br>
Performance: The booking page must load in less than 2 seconds. <br>
Security: The system must encrypt user passwords and payment information. <br>
Usability: The booking process should be intuitive and require a maximum of three clicks. <br>
Reliability: The system must have 99.9% uptime. <br>
Scalability: The system must be able to handle 1,000 concurrent users without a significant decrease in performance. <br>
<h2>Use Case Diagrams</h2>  
A Use Case Diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows a system's functionality from a user's perspective. <br>
Benefits of Use Case Diagrams <br>
- Simplifies Communication <br>
- Defines System Boundaries <br>
- Identifies Core Functionality <br>
- Foundation for Requirements <br>
<h2>Actors</h2>  
- User  <br>
