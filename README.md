# requirement-analysis

This repository serves as a guide to understanding and performing requirement analysis in software development. It contains detailed information on the key steps of the process, including elicitation, analysis, documentation, validation, and management. By providing a structured overview, this resource aims to equip developers, project managers, and business analysts with the knowledge and tools necessary to gather, define, and refine project requirements effectively. The purpose is to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned from the very beginning, setting a solid foundation for a successful project and a final product that truly meets user needs.  
<h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>  
The process of requirement analysis can be broken down into several key steps: <br>
Elicitation: This is the initial stage where requirements are gathered from all relevant stakeholders, including customers, end-users, project managers, and domain experts. Techniques like interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and observation are used to collect a broad range of needs and expectations. <br>
Analysis and Negotiation: Once collected, the requirements are analyzed for consistency, completeness, and feasibility. This step often involves negotiation to resolve conflicts between stakeholders' needs, prioritize requirements, and identify any missing information. The goal is to produce a clear, unambiguous set of requirements. <br>
Documentation: All finalized requirements are formally documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This document serves as the official record of what the software will do. It typically includes functional requirements and non-functional requirements. <br>
Validation: The documented requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and are technically feasible. This step helps catch errors and misunderstandings early, preventing costly rework later in the project. <br>
